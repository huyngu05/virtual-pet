## Overview

The **Virtual Pet Simulator** is a fun, interactive game where users take care of a digital pet. The pet has stats like hunger, energy, and happiness, and players can interact with it by feeding, playing with it, or putting it to sleep. As the game progresses, the pet ages and its stats change, creating a simple and engaging experience. This project helps demonstrate basic Python programming concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), loops, and conditionals.

## Features

- **Pet Stats**: Track the pet's hunger, energy, and happiness.
- **Interactive Actions**: Players can choose from actions like **feed**, **play**, and **sleep** to influence the pet's stats.
- **Pet Aging**: The pet ages over time, which may change its behavior or needs.
- **ASCII Art Representation**: A simple text-based visual representation of the pet (optional).
- **Status Updates**: The pet’s condition will be displayed regularly, allowing players to check on its needs and stats.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. You will be prompted to make choices, such as feeding, playing, or putting your pet to sleep.
3. The pet's stats (hunger, energy, happiness) will be updated based on your actions.
4. Try to keep your pet happy, healthy, and alive!
5. As the game progresses, your pet will age, and you may need to adapt your strategy.

## Getting Started


### Gameplay

- Use the following commands to interact with your pet:
    - **feed**: Feed your pet to improve its hunger stat.
    - **play**: Play with your pet to increase happiness.
    - **sleep**: Let your pet rest to regain energy.
    - **status**: Check the current stats of your pet.

## Project Structure

- `virtual_pet.py`: Main Python file that contains the logic for the game, including the pet class and the game loop.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining how to play the game and how it works.
- `assets/`: (Optional) Folder for storing any visual assets or ASCII art files.

## Roadmap

### Planned Features
- Add a **saving** and **loading** system so the pet’s state can be saved between sessions.
- Expand the pet’s needs with more actions, like "play outside" or "give medicine" for a sick pet.
- Improve the **ASCII art** representation of the pet and add more visual states (happy, sad, sick, etc.).
- Implement a **timer** system where the pet's stats degrade over real-time periods if not interacted with.

### Future Improvements
- Enhance the pet's behavior with more intelligent responses.
- Add a **health system**, where the pet can become sick if neglected.
- Implement **multiple pets** with different needs and personalities.
- Build a simple **GUI** for better interaction (using `tkinter` or similar).
