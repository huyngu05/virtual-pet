*The repository is currently empty but will include a `README.md` file and this proposal.*

## 5. Description
The **Virtual Pet Simulator** is a text-based Python game where users take care of a digital pet. Players can feed, play with, and monitor their pet's happiness, hunger, and energy. This project will provide a fun and interactive experience while learning to work with classes, loops, and conditionals in Python.

### Relevance to Digital Arts & Media
This project demonstrates how simple programming can be used to create interactive, engaging digital experiences. It merges basic game mechanics with digital art in a way that mimics real-world care-taking, which could inspire game developers or digital artists who focus on creating digital characters.

## 6. Features
- **Pet Stats**: Tracks the pet's hunger, energy, and happiness levels.
- **Interactive Commands**: Players can choose actions like "feed," "play," or "sleep" to affect the pet's stats.
- **Pet Aging**: The pet ages over time, with events like birthday celebrations or milestones.
- **Pet Needs**: The pet will become unhappy or sick if not taken care of, adding a challenge to the game.
- **Text-based Interface**: Uses simple text prompts and user input for interaction.
- **Graphical Representation (Optional)**: A simple ASCII art representation of the pet.

### How Features Will Be Executed:
- **Pet Stats** will be stored in a Python class as variables (e.g., `self.hunger`, `self.energy`).
- **Commands** will be implemented as functions, where user input calls the appropriate action.
- **Aging** will be simulated by increasing the pet's age every few rounds or based on user interaction.
- **Needs** will be checked regularly and displayed in status updates to the player.
- **ASCII Art** (optional) will be implemented by defining small images made of text, updated based on pet stats.

## 7. Challenges
- **Learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Using Python classes and objects to represent the pet and its attributes.
- **Time Simulation**: Implementing a time system where the pet's stats degrade over time if not maintained.
- **User Input Handling**: Designing a responsive user interface that accepts and processes player input effectively.
- **ASCII Art**: Creating an appealing and informative visual representation of the pet using simple text characters.

## 8. Outcomes

### Ideal Outcome:
- A fully functioning, interactive virtual pet game with multiple actions (feed, play, sleep), aging system, and pet stats.
- A simple ASCII art representation of the pet changes based on its state.
- Option for players to save their pet’s state and come back to it later.

### Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A basic pet simulator where the player can feed and play with the pet to maintain its happiness and health.
- No complex features like aging or ASCII art, but the pet’s stats (hunger, energy, happiness) will affect its behavior and the player’s interaction with it.

## 9. Milestones

### Week 1:
- **Milestone 1**: Create the basic structure of the game, including the `Pet` class with basic attributes (hunger, energy, happiness).
- **Milestone 2**: Implement basic actions (feed, play, sleep) and corresponding changes in pet stats.

### Week 2:
- **Milestone 3**: Introduce aging and stats deterioration over time. Add simple messages to simulate pet's needs.
- **Milestone 4**: (Optional) Implement ASCII art or basic visual representation of the pet.

### Week 3:
- **Milestone 5**: Finalize pet state saving and loading, test game flow, and make any final adjustments to the user interface.
